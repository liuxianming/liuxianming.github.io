title: About this site

---

This site if forked from [Ketch](https://github.com/ketch/labnotebook). Used as my personal website to record my thoughs, and publications.

---

This site is mostly static HTML, generated by [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)
from [source on Github](https://github.com/ketch/labnotebook).  You are free
to fork and modify it for your own needs.
It was originally based on Carl Boettiger's 
[labnotebook site](http://carlboettiger.info).
Carl publishes the source for his site on Github as the
[labnotebook project](http://github.com/cboettig/labnotebook) and
releases it all under [CC0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/),
so setting my site up was as easy as following 
[his instructions](http://www.carlboettiger.info/README.html),
replacing the \_posts directory, and making a few CSS customizations.

The [Publications page](publications.html) is generated from a bibtex file
using some [code I wrote to generate HTML divs from Bibtex](https://github.com/ketch/tex2_rst_html).
It also makes use of [jQuery](https://github.com/ketch/tex2_rst_html) and
[MixItUp](https://mixitup.kunkalabs.com/) for filtering and searching.

Please report any errors or other feedback in the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/ketch/labnotebook/issues).
